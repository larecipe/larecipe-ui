    LaRecipe UI
</h2>


This package is available on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@larecipe/larecipe-ui) and already ingtegrated in the LaRecipe packages for [Laravel](https://github.com/saleem-hadad/larecipe) and [.Net](https://github.com/larecipe/larecipe-dotnet).

The motivation behind extracting the UI into its own package is that now we have to support two different backend framework implementations and the UI should be the same. If you're planning to start a new backend integration for other frameworks please reach out to me (contact[at]saleem.dev) in case you need any support or onboarding to the development process.

This package includes the following components and logic which are needed to render the LaRecipe documentation pages.

> Note that the routing part is not part of this package and it must be handled in the corresponding backend framework.
